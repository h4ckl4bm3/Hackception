Cryptography allows people to carry over the confidence found in the physical world to the electronic world, thus allowing<br/> people to do business electronically without worries of deceit and deception. Every day hundreds of thousands of people <br/> interact electronically, whether it is through e-mail, e-commerce (business conducted over the Internet), ATM machines, or <br/> cellular phones. The perpetual increase of information transmitted electronically has lead to an increased reliance on <br/> cryptography.<br/> <br/> <br/> 



The Internet, comprised of millions of interconnected computers, allows nearly instantaneous communication and transfer of <br/> information, around the world. People use e-mail to correspond with one another,especially their loved ones.<br/> The World Wide Web is used for online business, data distribution, marketing, research, learning, and a myriad of other activities.<br/> <br/> 

Cryptography makes secure web sites (see Question 5.1.2) and electronic safe transmissions possible. For a web site to be <br/> secure all of the data transmitted between the computers where the data is kept and where it is received must be encrypted. <br/> This allows people to do online banking, online trading, and make online purchases with their credit cards, without worrying <br/> that any of their account information is being compromised. Cryptography is very important to the continued growth <br/> of the Internet and electronic commerce.<br/> <br/> 


E-commerce is increasing at a very rapid rate. By the turn of the century, commercial transactions on the <br/> Internet are expected to total hundreds of billions of dollars a year. This level of activity could not be supported without <br/> cryptographic security. It has been said that one is safer using a credit card over the Internet than within a store or <br/> restaurant. It requires much more work to seize credit card numbers over computer networks than it does to simply walk by<br/>  a table in a restaurant and lay hold of a credit card receipt. These levels of security, though not yet widely used, give<br/>  the means to strengthen the foundation with which e-commerce can grow.<br/> <br/> 

People use e-mail to conduct personal and business matters on a daily basis. E-mail has no physical form and may exist <br/> electronically in more than one place at a time. This poses a potential problem as it increases the opportunity for an <br/> eavesdropper to get a hold of the transmission. Encryption protects e-mail by rendering it very difficult to read by any <br/> unintended party. Digital signatures can also be used to authenticate the origin and the content of an e-mail message.<br/> <br/>

In some cases cryptography allows you to have more confidence in your electronic transactions than you do in real life <br/> transactions. For example, signing documents in real life still leaves one vulnerable to the following scenario. After signing<br/>  your will, agreeing to what is put forth in the document, someone can change that document and your signature is still<br/>  attached. In the electronic world this type of falsification is much more difficult because digital signatures (see Question 2.2.2)<br/>  are built using the contents of the document being signed.<br/> <br/>

Cryptography is also used to regulate access to satellite and cable TV. Cable TV is set up so people can watch only the <br/> channels they pay for. Since there is a direct line from the cable company to each individual subscriber's home, the Cable <br/> Company will only send those channels that are paid for. Many companies offer pay-per-view channels to their subscribers. <br/> Pay-per-view cable allows cable subscribers to "rent" a movie directly through the cable box. What the cable box does is <br/> decode the incoming movie, but not until the movie has been ``rented.'' If a person wants to watch a pay-per-view movie, he/she<br/>  calls the cable company and requests it. In return, the Cable Company sends out a signal to the subscriber's cable box, <br/> which unscrambles (decrypts) the requested movie.<br/> <br/> 

Satellite TV works slightly different method since the satellite TV companies do not have a direct connection to each individual <br/> subscriber's home. This means that anyone with a satellite dish can pick up the signals. To alleviate the problem of people <br/> getting free TV, they use cryptography. The trick is to allow only those who have paid for their service to unscramble the <br/> transmission; this is done with receivers (``unscramblers''). Each subscriber is given a receiver; the satellite <br/> transmits signals that can only be unscrambled by such a receiver (ideally). Pay-per-view works in essentially the same way as<br/>  it does for regular cable TV.<br/> <br/> 

As seen, cryptography is widely used. Not only is it used over the Internet, but also it is used in phones, televisions, and a<br/>  variety of other common household items. Without cryptography, hackers could get into our e-mail, listen in on our phone <br/> conversations, tap into our cable companies and acquire free cable service, or break into our bank/brokerage accounts.<br/> <br/>
